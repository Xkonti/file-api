# file-api
A simple RESTful API that allows you to manipulate files and directories.

‚ö†Ô∏è This project is in early development stage.

üíÄ There are no robust protections against malicious users. This API is intended to be used as an internal API for simple projects. Usage of a service mesh that encrypts traffic between services is recommended.
