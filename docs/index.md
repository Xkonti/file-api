# File API documentation

A simple RESTful API that allows you to manipulate files and directories.

> [!WARNING]
> This project is in early development stage.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ðŸ’€ There are no robust protections against malicious users. This API is intended to be used as an internal API for simple projects. Usage of a service mesh that encrypts traffic between services is recommended.

## Setup

- [Running a Docker container](setup/docker.md)
- [API key](setup/apiKey.md)

## Endpoints

- Enumerate
  - [`GET /list` - List files and directories](endpoints/list/getList.md)
- Files
  - [`GET /file` - Download a file](endpoints/file/getFile.md)
  - [`POST /file` - Upload a file](endpoints/file/uploadFile.md)
  - [`GET /file/exists` - Check if a file exists](endpoints/file/checkFileExists.md)
  - [`GET /file/size` - Get the size of a file](endpoints/file/getFileSize.md)
